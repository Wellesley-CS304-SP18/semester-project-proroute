# semester-project-proroute
ProRoute is a site intended to provide a mixture of networking and mentoring combining aspects of LinkedIn and the Wellesley Hive. Mentors would provide information on their professions , jobs, fields, as well as the path that got them to where they are. Students would be able to their profiles and engage with them in the general forum where questions would be answered by the professionals in those respective fields. The focus is on the narrative portion of someone's career path that is usually not included on sites such as LinkedIn, Handshake, etc. to educate and inspire others on the different backgrounds of other people and how they navigated through a certain space.
